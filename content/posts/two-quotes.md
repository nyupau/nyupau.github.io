## Two quotes

To start off our new website, we wanted to share two quotes. 

The first is from Yin:

> "It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future." (English translation)
> 
> "Det er vanskeligt at spaa, især naar det gælder Fremtiden."


And the second, slightly less profound, quote is from Walter:

> "Have you tried changing the learning rate?"
